      "We worked as a team of developers, with three of us in the front end and the others in the back end. The project spanned three weeks, with three sprints each, following the Scrum methodology and supervised by a Product Owner. We created an e-commerce platform focused on furniture and design, addressing both the client side and the administrator side. Technologies employed included React, Vite.js, CSS modules, Redux, JavaScript, Node.js, Postman, Express.js, Nodemon, MercadoPago for payment processing, Cloudinary for image management, third-party authentication, and various libraries.",

    description:
      "I developed a RESTful Pokémon API by fetching data from the official Pokémon API available online. Initially, the server-side implementation was carried out, where requests to the API were made, and database models were created to store Pokémon data in Redux. This allowed us to manage information across global states without the need for constant requests. Subsequently, a visually appealing front end was crafted where Pokémon can be viewed and filtered in various ways. Users can search for Pokémon by name using a search bar, and a form is available for creating and deleting custom Pokémon.",
